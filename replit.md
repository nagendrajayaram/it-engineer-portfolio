## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a simple static website architecture with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- **HTML Structure**: Single-page application with section-based navigation using anchor links
- **CSS Framework**: Custom CSS with responsive design and mobile-first approach using Flexbox and CSS Grid
- **JavaScript Approach**: Vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation for dynamic content management
- **Data Management**: Client-side localStorage for persistent data storage without requiring a backend

### Component Structure
- **Navigation**: Fixed header with hamburger menu for mobile responsiveness
- **Hero Section**: Landing area with personal introduction
- **Content Sections**: Modular sections for different portfolio categories (skills, education, projects, etc.)
- **Interactive Features**: Edit mode functionality for content management
- **Data Storage**: JSON-based localStorage system for each content category

### Design Patterns
- **Module Pattern**: JavaScript functionality organized into logical modules (navigation, data loading, settings)
- **Data Abstraction**: Centralized storage configuration object for managing localStorage keys
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced features require JS
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first CSS approach with breakpoints for different screen sizes

### Content Management
- **Edit Mode**: Toggle-able editing interface for updating portfolio content (hidden by default)
- **Dynamic Content**: Add/edit/delete functionality for all content sections
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with length limits and format checking
- **Data Sanitization**: Secure DOM manipulation to prevent XSS attacks
- **Local Persistence**: All changes stored in browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions
- **Settings Management**: Configurable profile links (LinkedIn, email, GitHub) with validation

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Font Awesome 6.0.0**: Icon library loaded from cdnjs.cloudflare.com for UI icons and social media symbols

### Browser APIs
- **localStorage API**: For client-side data persistence
- **DOM API**: For dynamic content manipulation and event handling
- **CSS3 Features**: Modern CSS properties for animations, transitions, and responsive layout

### No Backend Dependencies
The application is designed to run entirely in the browser without requiring:
- Database servers
- Backend frameworks
- Authentication services
- External APIs (beyond CDN resources)

This architecture makes the portfolio easily deployable to static hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
